Lesson 18- Microbit

At the start of the lesson I got my microbit as I hadn't been there last week and it came with a charger, a few wires and a USB to plug into the monitor to put the code in the microbit and it will light up with the code.

Then we started to talk about the links we had to put in last week's blog post. We talked about the dangers of sexting and revenge porn and why not to do it. Apparently people as young as 11 have been involved in this so this is why our teacher wants to talk about it. Lots of questions were asked and answered and we talked about it for the majority of the lesson.

Our only homework was to do a normal blog post this week. Thanks for reading this week's blog post!
