Lesson 4- Social Media

On Friday, I wasn't at the lesson because I had football however from what my friends have told me this is what happened in the lessonâ€¦

At the start of the lesson we looked at our homework and discussed the question and listened to lots of different answers. The question was 'how can your current or future social media affect your goals and aspirations for the future?'. I answered mine using disadvantages and advantages. My main advantage was how you can kind of advertise yourself using social media. For example I have a youtube channel where I play football with my friend. If you want to get payed on youtube if lots of people watch you or you want to show your videos to maybe even a scout to join a club then using social media in this way can be an advantage! One of my  disadvantages was that if you in the past made a rude or mean comment on someone else's photo or yours then when you are in a job interview and they look at this history it will diminish your chances of getting the job you want to get.

Afterwards we watched a video where there were a group of people who were all on their phone. When the girl got a bowling strike she celebrated but the others didn't see it because they were fixed on their phone, on social media. When they went for dinner she tried to make a conversation but they were all again fixed on their phones. The message that was trying to be sent was that we need to make the most of the great moments in life rather than not living the moment and just videoing it to get loads of likes on facebook!

Finally we got in groups of three. We had to make up ten social media rules per group. After we made them up we discussed the different rules as a class. The most occurring rules were like 'social media is a good way to find out important things like homework' and maybe a restriction on the amount of time you should be spending on social media or making sure you live in the moment rather than record it all the time!
