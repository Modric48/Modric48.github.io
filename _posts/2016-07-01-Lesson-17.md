Lesson 17- Microbit

I was not at the lesson yesterday as I had a cricket match to go to for the school but I heard vaguely what happened from what my friends have told and shown me and that is what I will put in this blog post.

Firstly, the microbits have now finally arrived (annoyed I wasn't there!) and at the beginning of the lesson they set them up. I saw Sonny’s one and they were small but cool. I can’t wait to set mine up and start putting codes into my microbit. These microbits were meant to arrive when we started on this topic but for some reason they were delayed but now we’ve got them! For the end of the lesson we apparently talked about sexting and revenge porn articles which we have been asked to add a link to on our blog post - below.

Our homework was to do these links, this blog post and again another 30 minutes on our microbit game. Thanks for reading this week's blog post!
