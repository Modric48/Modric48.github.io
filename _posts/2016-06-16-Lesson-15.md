Lesson 15- Microbit

Like last week, today we were in IT2 with the apple macs. Like usual we checked if everyone had completed the homework, 11 people hadn't! Our teacher gave us time though in the lesson to make sure we handed the work in. Some others who had already done it (like me) had the choice to have a go at making it better as the few we went through were not detailed enough. 

After that we were allowed to start on our microbit games. I worked with Henry for the rest of the lesson and we got some of the coding done. Unfortunately at the end of the lesson we had to log out and I was still coding. I tried to copy and paste the raw code onto docs but for some reason it didn't let me. So I don't have any coding but at least we hadn't done that much and I now know what Iâ€™m doing.

Our homework was to, like always, do our blog post and spend 30 minutes on our microbit game!
