**                           ****Lesson 6- CEOP**

**    **

At the start of the lesson we checked on google classroom if everyone had handed in last week's homework. Everyone had sent the image of their identity map, however 5 people forgot to add the link to their blog page (this is my blog page) although pretty much everyone had wrote a blog post on their page.

Before we got into the main part of the lesson we quickly had a look and discussed the death of 14 year-old Breck Bednar and how he was slowly turned against everyone else by his later murderer. Lewis Daynes-the murderer- hosted the lobby of the game Breck was playing, slowly Breck got persuaded by Lewis that his family and friends were wrong and that he was right(Lewis). When Breck's mother realised there was something going on she called the police but they didn't detect anything suspicious, eventually they met up(Breck and Lewis) and that is when he was brutally stabbed. We got from this and understood that 'snitching’ isn't a bad thing and if Breck’s friends did something Breck might have not been stabbed.

Then we looked at this set of youtube videos where there were two mini groups of people trying to be the first to get a million views on youtube. As it got more serious and more serious we made a class decision before everything they filmed for their videos. Eventually it got out of hand and some really rude and mean things were posted just for views. We learnt that you have to be careful of the sort of things you post and think whether it is appropriate or not.
