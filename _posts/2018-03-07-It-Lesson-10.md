**_IT Lesson 10- Making a conversation in Python!_**

In today's lesson we started by looking at a few different chatbots on the internet. We looked at two different ones; Cleverbot and a more advanced Mitsuku. It was interesting to see how they responded to all sorts of questions so human-like and with very few errors. Mitsuku in particular seemed very real. 

We then used these examples and tried to make something of our own. We discussed how we used simple terms like 'input' and ‘print’ to make the beginning of our AI conversation and than we used other variables to increase its human-likeness! For example we used ‘if’ to create multiple responses depending on what the person says. For example, when asking "how are you?", if they replied “good” there would be a certain response and if they replied “bad” there would be a certain response. Then if the answer didn’t meet one of the responses you would use ‘else’ to have a certain response. In that example you may put “I don’t understand can you please repeat?” until the response meets a answer that is set to the computer. You have to use ‘while True’ for this so it’s response carries on like this however many times before the programme understands the answer. For homework we need to add to our conversation by putting in three more questions!
