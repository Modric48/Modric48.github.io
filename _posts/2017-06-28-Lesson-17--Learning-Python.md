    <td>Today I worked effectively with my partner, Dom, as we were still on the same bit. We worked efficiently by helping each other and therefore got quite far into the next section, 'a day at the supermarket'. Like last week, reading the instructions and information helped me understand what I was meant to be doing. This helped me get the coding correct and therefore get more done in the lesson.</td>
