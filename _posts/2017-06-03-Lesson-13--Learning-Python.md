    <td>This weeks blog post is going to be slightly different as I will be talking about what I have completed in the homework task. This task was to do 2 hours of coding over the half term and I didn't start until the first weekend off as before that I was doing revision for my EOY exams. I decided to do 3 40-45 minute sessions throughout the week off.

In my first session I started doing some coding on parameters and arguments and I completed that lesson fairly quickly. I understood that the function power should take two arguments, a base and an exponent, and raise the first to the power of the second. I used 37 and 4 and it worked out the sum of 37 to the power of 4 which was a long number. However the next few lessons where I learnt about functions calling functions and practicing it I found a bit trickier but eventually got it after a while.

In my second session I carried on with the function section and the first two lessons I learnt how to square root and how you need to import math and use math. before the sqrt() for the console to understand that instruction. In the third lesson it then explained how you don't have to use math. before sqrt() every time you want to square root something. However if you use import * it can link to many different functions and modules. In the next few lessons it showed different functions that are already imported into the console and how to use them.

In my final session I carried on with my function work and the first lesson involved use a function called max(). I learnt that this function takes any number of arguments and returns the largest one. Because the definition of largest can depend on what you’re using it is best to use things like integers (numbers). You have to have the integers within the brackets of max() to work though. The following function- min()- did the exact opposite but worked in the same way. The next function was abs() which found how far away a number is from 0. Therefore in abs(), -3 and 3 would have the same value. This function always returns as a positive number. The following function, type(), worked out what type of code you used, so 1 would be integer, 2.3 would be float and 'spam’ would be str. To complete the functions section I did a lesson on reviewing functions and then one on modules. Finally I had to use built-in functions and after a while I found how i went wrong and got it right, that completed the functions sections and my homework!
