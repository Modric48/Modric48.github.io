**IT Overview Paragraph**

During the course of Year 8 I have learnt a lot of new things about IT and I've had a great time learning new things in a way that requires more thought than other subjects in the school. I've realised that it is more than just programming but it's also about deciding who you want to be the, what kind of person you are and if you want to succeed. It requires actual hard work and it needs mistakes for success. I've realised also realised the importance of this subject much more over the year. After all, technology is the future.
