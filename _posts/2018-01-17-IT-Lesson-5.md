**_IT Lesson 5- Recapping 'Virtual Shop' Work_**

In today's lesson we recapped the work we had done over the last few weeks on our 'Virtual Shopâ€™ sheets. We went over how we have used different methods on sheets to quicken up and sophisticate our Virtual Shops further. We firstly discussed how we use data validation to quickly find certain items. Then we discussed how we used VLookup to select all the items in a column and so it would still work if we added stock down that same column (A).  We finally went over how the discount works and the code that we need to use for it. This was the code I used to find the discount price of the item/(s): =if(F9>=F14,(G10*G13),G10). This changes between different peoples programmes as the boxes different uses are probably not the same!
