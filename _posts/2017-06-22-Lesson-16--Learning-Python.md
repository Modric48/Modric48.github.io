    <td>In this lesson I sat next to Dom and we worked together well as we were on the same part. The first lesson took me quite a while to complete as we did not understand it at the start. After a hint from our teacher we understood that the numbers were connected to the letters, working from the number 0 as the first letter. After that we could through a few fairly quickly. In these lessons we had to separate words to make sure they make sense with numbers. The numbers represented each different letter. We splitted the three words cat, frog and dog. 

Nearer the end of the lesson our teacher asked how we were doing with our coding and I was about or just under 40% which seemed to be the class average, or at least the class expectation. After that he went on about why we do coding and that this part is the easy part! He mentioned how the subject of IT is actually very important as the world will be even more tech-based when we are trying to find a job when we are older. Therefore the skill of IT is very important if it isn't already. 

He also said this. Do you want to be a hard-worker who will have an important job that pays well or a mcdonald’s worker who says 'do you want some fries with that’? He didn’t say it as bluntly as that but that was the main message and I have decided that I definitely want to head in the direction of the first option!</td>
