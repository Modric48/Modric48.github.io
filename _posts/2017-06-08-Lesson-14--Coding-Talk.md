    <td>In today's lesson, instead of doing the usual codecademy, we went into the other IT lab with the other class and had a discussion/talk about coding and how we need to be detailed and not make assumptions. 

The first thing we did was discuss the instructions to making a cup of tea. After going through instructions we considered how they would fair against a computer in python and agreed that we need to be very detailed and label things that computers don't understand in coding. We made assumptions but if an alien was reading these, like a computer, they still wouldn't know how to do it. So going back over it we made instructions that a robot arm would be able to do and we figured that it was very difficult. 

After that our teacher told us to stand up and sit down. This was simple but we realised it was simple because that instruction has been done and done again (revised) that it is stuck in our brain. Then we did it again, faster and then slower. We were told to try and recognise all the parts of the body we were using. It shows that even for something simple, a lot of things are going on and this related to coding. One thing we noticed is that we tend to lean forward before we sit up so our centre of gravity is balanced. The point of the lesson, overall was to understand that we can’t assume thing in coding unless they are already implanted to the system and make the most basic and detailed instructions as possible. If you just said 'boil the kettle’ there are already so many questions that could be asked if you are an alien and have no idea what this is for example.</td>
