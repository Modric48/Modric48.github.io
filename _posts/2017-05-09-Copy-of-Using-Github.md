    <td>Today I missed over half of the lesson as I had to leave early for a cricket game. Therefore, I did not get as much done as I would normally hope but I will make up to it at home by doing some coding on codecademy for around half an hour to 40 mins. In the time I was in the lesson I worked through a few exercises in the conditionals and control flow topic and I got to the final exercise of the section.  </td>
