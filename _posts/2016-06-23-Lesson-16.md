Lesson 16- Microbit

At the start of the lesson we checked if everybody had handed in the link to their github page (this!) and 3 people hadn't. They proceeded to do so. Then, as long as your blog page was fine (mine was) we could carry on with our game.

 Today in the time we had me and Henry sort of completed our game! By sort of we have essentially finished it but we can't find the coding in Javascript that will allow us to do five rounds of our game instead of 1. Hopefully we will sort that out next week! Finally at the very end of the lesson our teacher put up a survey on classroom which we quickly completed slightly late of the bell.
