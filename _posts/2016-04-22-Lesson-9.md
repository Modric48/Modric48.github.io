Lesson 9- Microbit

In today's lesson we looked into a software called microbit. We were meant to have are own microbits but the delivery of them are late! We looked at this site where you can give this microbit different commands. There were tutorials like making a dice and there were different codes with different tutorials on them.

For the rest of the lesson we were asked to play around with it and see what we could make. I found out lots of cool commands and the layout reminded me of scratch we did earlier in the year a bit. We were also allowed to go on youtube to watch videos of how to make different things on microbit if it wasn't an option on one of the tutorials.

By the end I had made a dice, attempted to make maze runner (both on javascript code) and I had a play with the other codes too which offered different aspects. Sorry that this week's blog was quite short but we didn't do much other than play around!
