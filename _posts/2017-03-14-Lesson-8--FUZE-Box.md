    <td>Today I did not attend the lesson because I was at a football match, therefore the short amount of information I give to you in this blog will be from what Kiran, my partner, has told me about what happened in the lesson (visit his page at kiran-246.github.io). He worked with Tom Guy as his partner did not attend too so that worked out quite well for them.</td>

    <td>He told me that they completed the true, false exercise (which we were working on last week) and began the flashing lights excercise. In this exercise they had to manually plug in different lights in certain places. He told me that this is what he and Tom found particularly hard and as Tom is of a similar skill level to me, it would have probably been the same if I was there today with Kiran. He said they were in a rush and that they needed to be more organsied after evaluating the lesson.</td>

    <td>For next time I will make sure I'm organised and not in a rush (and hopefully in the lesson) for the flashing lights excercise so we can hopefully move on further and get it done!</td>
