    <td>Like usual we learnt by taking in turns to code and taking in turns to read and tell the coder what to put. Today we worked on two sets of Coding. In the first one we made a working 1 to 100 random number generator which allowed 10 guesses. After each guess it would let us know if it was right or that the chosen number was higher or lower and we got it right after 9 attempts in our first try after completing the Coding. The second set of coding we nearly fully completed  but we had to rush to get to the end of a section of it at the end.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>At the start of the lesson we took longer to get set up because another pair had already taken our usual spot. We also didn't get coding for a while as I had to gather some of the coding onto my memory stick from Kirans memory stick from the two lessons that I wasn't there. Another thing that limited my working was that we were unsure of the order of the coding in the second set as there were lots of different sections in it. I need to work on making sure that I'm quick but careful when I'm coding to enable myself to learn the most and get the most done.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure that I'm more prepared to set up and save anything across if need be. I will improve my learning and blog post by packing up more quickly so I can write down notes in docs of what we did in the lesson for our blog posts (this!). Also I have realised that you don't  always have to copy the coding exactly especially when there are speech marks for the questions for example. This will make coding quicker!</td>
