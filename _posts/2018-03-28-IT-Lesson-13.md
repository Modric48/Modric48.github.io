**_IT Lesson 13_**

In today's lesson we looked at how to (in python 3) use code to find out if numbers are even or odd and then we moved on to using the same sort of logic to try and code to find out if numbers were prime or not. 

We also talked about how, for example, the google calculator couldn't calculate 64-bit binary (it just read infinity) when the largest prime number found (found this month) is 23,249,425 digits long!
