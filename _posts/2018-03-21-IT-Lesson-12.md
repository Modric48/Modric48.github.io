**_IT Lesson 12- 3D Letters in Python Turtle_**

In today's lesson we carried on with making the letters of our name in python turtle but now in 3D. This was much more difficult because there were more angles and lengths that we had to figure out and it took a lot longer for each letter than it did previously. I’m going to make the word 'tommo’ (my nickname). I have finished coding the ‘O’ and I am now working on doing the ‘M’ and the ‘T’. Luckily the 5-letter word I’m doing only requires 3 different letters which will make it a bit easier for me, however, I still need to make sure the spaces between the letters are even! Homework: this blog post and carry on with our 3D letters.
