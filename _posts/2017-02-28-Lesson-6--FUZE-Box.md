    <td>I learned by sharing the reading and coding with my partner Kiran like usual. However, today I developed a new, simple but very effective strategy which enabled us to get more work done than usual. This was by simply using the caps lock button. Because there is a lot of capital letters and changing from them to lowercase letters in the coding, this strategy proved helpful. The reader called out the changes to whether it was caps lock or not as well as the words and punctuation which meant that the coder could go quicker without checking it himself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Whilst we were coding we realised that we had coded a set of coding that was one section ahead that we were mean to. We thought we had done the previous section so we plugged in kirans memory stick so we could paste the coding behind what we had done as they had to be put together . Unfortunately we hadn't. Also the fact that I had to paste a file across to my memory stick throughout the coding slowed us down because I realised that Kiran had one more stage than me. I need to work on understanding the book more so we both know what and which coding we are doing in the correct order.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that we are more prepared and know exactly what coding we need to do and what the results should be. I will also improve my learning by keeping our new technique and see if I can try to adapt any more new ones as well. Hopefully next week we will be able to get closer and maybe even get onto the next stages which in the end end up by trying to control a robot arm which I really want to get to and try out as it looks challenging but exciting! But we will need to be very productive in the next lesson if we want to get onto that!</td>
