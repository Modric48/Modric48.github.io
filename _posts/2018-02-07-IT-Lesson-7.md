**_IT Lesson 7- Coding in Sheets_**

In today's lesson, we begun by having letters on the board and we had to try to decode them. We figured out that if you moved one letter back from the alphabet that it would work out to say 'Hello World'! We then made this in docs using Vlookup. After that we made it code the other way for someone possibly receiving a coded message (who knows the rule for that code) so that they could find out what it really meant straight away!
