Lesson 8- PREZI

 At the start of the lesson we first checked who had and hadn't done the easter project (I did!) which was to make a prezi on the history of computers and we had to write about 11 different people, he told us who to write about on google classroom.

After listen to people's excuses we started looking at some people’s prezis at random. We looked at George’s, Soham’s and Michael’s. Michaels was the best. We tried to spot mistakes and stuff we could improve on next time. This is because as part of our homework we have to improve our prezi for nexts week.

 At the end of the lesson we quickly did a blog assessment on the person next to us, I assessed henry and he assessed me. It was on things like if they've done enough posts, if it’s good quality and quantity. We were able to tick 'it hurts my eyes’, ‘could be better’ ‘ok’, ‘good’ or ‘awesome’. We also ticked from an overall and gave three possible improvements at the end, then we submitted it.

Thanks for reading this week's blog post!
