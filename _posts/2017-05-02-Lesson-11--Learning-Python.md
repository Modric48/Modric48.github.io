    <td>Today I learnt quite a few different commands and features of python coding which at first was confusing but then got easier to understand with the help of friends, hints and actual reading. I found out that in the long-term, reading all of the examples and instructions made everything easier and quicker as they generally tell you precisely what to do. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today I was faster than last lesson but still not the fastest that I could be in my coding work. This is because I found quite a few exercises challenging that my friends didn't. However, a large part of coding in year 8 is about making mistakes and knowing what to do after making a mistake before turning to your peers and teachers. This is a habit that needs to go away.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will therefore improve my learning by focusing hard whilst I read over the examples, instructions and even hint if iâ€™m really stuck. Also I need to see where the code is wrong because in the box it normally tells you the correct line that you have made a mistake in. If I try harder to do this next lesson I think, even if I don't get as far, I will take in and learn more from it than doing it any other way!</td>
