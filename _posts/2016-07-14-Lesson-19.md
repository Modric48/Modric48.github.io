Lesson 19- Talking Lesson

Todays lesson was the last lesson of the school year so unfortunately I'm not going to be posting anymore blogs (I don't think)! It has been a great year and I have learnt a lot in this subject!

Today we spent the lesson covering some of the stuff we have been learning about recently like sexting and porn. We clarified their meanings and discussed what different types there are. We also verified what different types and in what circumstances it is illegal to do, send,etc- these things. Our teacher told us a few stories (like usual) today about these sort of things and I'm surprised how young some of the people who are involved in them are.

That was all for today's lesson, I hope you have enjoyed my blog posts this year- despite the fact that probably the only person who is reading this is one of my classmates who is copying them and this one and has copied this part as well- and goodbye!
