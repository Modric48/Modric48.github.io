    <td>Because we had finished short of a piece of coding last week I had to get my memory stick out and we figured out how to get it back onto our edit. We did this by pressing open instead of saving which is what we normally do. This week Kiran started the coding. Unfortunately after about 5-10 minutes Kiran tried to run the complete coding but it didn't work and it didn't even let us back to the coding so we had to reload it. When we tried to get it back from my memory stick it hadn't saved it, like expected, so I tried the same coding and it worked. We also had to shut the monitor down later on (explanation in next section).</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The fact that we had to redo a section of coding because of a silly error (it was Kiran!) lost us quite a lot of time so once we had got the coding right we saved it immediately to our memory sticks to make sure we didn't lose it again. Later on we had to shutdown the monitor as we couldn't get the coding to run on the next stage we began because there was a lot of windows that were open. For some reason it did not allow us to close the windows but we knew that the work had already been saved so we shut down the monitor. The new coding was short anyway so it didn't lose us as much time as the other problem but it still didn't help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Even though a lot went wrong this lesson, I now feel more comfortable in my understanding of how the saving and opening of files work. I will improve my learning by making sure my pair and I check the coding thoroughly before running it as there are consequences if you don't and you haven't already saved it as what happened can happen. Luckily we had already saved most of the coding from the week before,like I said, though so it wasn't as bad a mistake as it could have been which is good to know. I didn't realise that there was more coding before the stage that I mentioned next week be we should hopefully actually be onto that part next week which I'm still very excited for!</td>
