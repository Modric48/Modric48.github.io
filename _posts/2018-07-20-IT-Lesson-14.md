In today's lesson we worked on our python coding to make a quiz. My quiz is going to be on 'What football team do you support?' I have started the first few questions. The teams available are Man city, Man.Utd, Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs (my team). I am onto question 3 which determines what team you support from types of weather!
