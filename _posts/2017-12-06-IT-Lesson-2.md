**_IT Lesson 2 - Carrying On With Spreadsheets_**

In today's lesson, we carried on with our work on learning how to use spreadsheets. We went into the same sheet as last week to carry on working on our shops. We brought in the idea of discounts like if you buy 5 or more of a certain type of item you get 40% of all the items. We did this by adding a statement saying 'IF the cell with amount purchased is more or equal to the cell with amount needed for the discount, then you would get the discount. Therefore if it is less than the amount needed then the discount wouldn't go through- it would say FALSE.
