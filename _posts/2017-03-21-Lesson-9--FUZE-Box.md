    <td>Today we got going on the flashing light exercise and we had to get some equipment out as we would be manually doing the coding (on the breadboard) as well as on the monitor. Not only did we get the light working today, but we also made it flash! It did take the whole lesson though and it took a while before we figured it out as we were very confused at the start. We thought the picture in the book was wrong but it turns out that if you copied it it did actually work. To get it flashing we had to add some coding but that was on the monitor as it was connected. Here is a picture but I couldn't add a video to show the flashing as it doesnt let me. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The fact that the instructions seemed to be not very clear made it hard for us. It turns out that we just had to look at it from another angle (not literally) and once we realised the first bit it was much easier and made much more sense. If we had concentrated slightly harder and not given up on the book so quickly we might have been able to start on the next part. We also need to remember to save everything as we nearly forgot to do that!</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will know how to follow the book's instructions more carefully and remember that I need to save everything I do onto my memory stick. I will improve my learning by not giving up as that really is what the point of working with coding is from what we've done so far in Year 8! We were very pleased with ourselves when the light on and off and the flashing worked because you realise that we did that coding pretty much from scratch and I never thought that I would be able to do that.</td>
