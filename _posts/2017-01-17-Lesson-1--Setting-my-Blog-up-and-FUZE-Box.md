    <td>I re-learned how to set up my blog post and made sure that my site was publishing properly. At first my site was not working but then I read the slides and docs to help on the classroom and I managed to find the problem and fix it. Today I paired with Kiran and I learned how to set up the fuze box to the monitor and we also learned how to do the first stage of basic coding.  This coding eventually displayed the words Hello World repeatedly appearing on our screen, it was actually quite simple, however, very rewarding! After that we saved our work in our memory stick!  </td>

    <td>At the start of the first lesson I was limited because I could not work out why my page wasn't working after multiple attempts. I had to end up going round to someone’s house after school where I found the solution. I now also have a problem where my page says I am in the wrong engine which is 'redcarpet’ markdown. I will see if it is still working we I hopefully successfully publish it onto my page! For the fuze box coding, I have habits of restarting as soon as I get any coding that doesn’t work. This may have limited my work progress as if I had tried to find out how to redo the coding without reloading the site it would have helped me in the long run   </td>

    <td>Next time I will look more into my page build warning and if I can’t figure it out I might have to go to mr Keen who is available on wednesdays. As I have a football game tomorrow, there is a chance that I will have to do this next wednesday. I will improve my coding learning by trying to persevere more and find out how to redo the coding without making multiple documents.I will change next lesson by being quicker at putting out the fuze box, saving my work and packing up to make sure I can get as much coding completed as possible.</td>
