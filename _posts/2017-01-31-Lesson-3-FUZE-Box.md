    <td>Before I begin my first question, I would like to mention that the reason that I didn't do a blog post last week is because I was very ill and therefore absent ( I thought that if I did a blog post it would be to short as I wouldn't be able to add as much detail because I would have only got my information from Kiran). We carried on from where Kiran got to on his own last week. This week, we adapted a new strategy of taking turns to read and type the coding and this definitely enabled and helped us to get a lot of coding done and have the most effective week so far! </td>

    <td>At the start we struggled to get the FUZE box working after several attempts so we had to ask our teacher and in the end the reason it wasn't working was because the cable connected to the monitor was not fully connected. This lost us some time and now I know that I need to work on solving problems that I encounter with my partner and without the teacher's assistance! This lost us about 5 minutes work time but luckily we were efficient in the lesson so we didn't fall behind. We also struggled to save our work at the end but eventually we found the coding.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure we check everything to make the FUZE Box work before we ask for any help and I will also know specifically how to efficiently save my work so I have more time to write up details for this blog post at the end and therefore diminish the amount of homework that I would have to do! I will also improve my learning by making sure I code and save my work much quicker and consequently get more done in lesson.</td>
