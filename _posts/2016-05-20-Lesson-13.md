Lesson 13- Microbit

In today's lesson (in the first half), before we moved back to our tutorials we discussed occurring problems people were having and different ways we could fix them. One specific problem we addressed that I had is that if your raw coding has a red line or an 'X' it almost always means you have uneven brackets. However, the red line is for some reason not always where the mistake is so you have to find it yourself by looking through the whole code. Also we discussed how coding does not work without numbers because words in a string mean nothing to a computer because they don't know what you mean. It’s the same if you make new variables, the computer doesn't know what the strings mean, but if it’s a command that’s in the programming language it does. It’s like maths because it’s impossible to answer a question without numbers/ with letters. In algebra numbers are just substituted for letters, the letter still means the number you substituted it for. E.G. Say f=3, 3f+4 is the same as saying 3x3+4. 

For the second half of the lesson we carried on with our tutorials and because we have exam and activity week then half term for a week we aren't having a lesson for 3 weeks. Therefore, our homework is extended to 1 hour and a half on work on our tutorials. Thanks for reading this week's blog post!
