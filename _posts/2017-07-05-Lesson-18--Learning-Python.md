    <td>This lesson I sat next to Kiran because Dom moved elsewhere. I started off fairly slow as my first lesson took ages to do. I found out that the reason for this was because this was one of the only lessons in the whole of the Python learning that didn't work when you got it right. After my teacher checked it was that one he gave me permission to move onto the next one. From there I worked fairly quickly and ended up finishing the section fairly quickly. I worked effectively in the lesson .</td>
