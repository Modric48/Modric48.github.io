**_It Lesson 9- Repl.it Coding _**

In today's lesson, we switched labs as we have now started our 2nd and last term doing IT (we also switched teacher). We started by looking at Python (turtle) on a website called 'repl.it’. We worked out how to create different shapes in different ways. We found that the quickest way was to give ‘sides’ and ‘length’ as a variable, so once we had done the coding, we would just have to type in the numbers we wanted. For example, a pentagon would be ‘sides = 5’ and ‘length = X’. After this we attempted to add more complex ideas to our shape and how it is drawn; colour, speed(drawing speed), shape (e.g. rose), cursor shape (e.g. turtle), etc.
