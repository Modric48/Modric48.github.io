                **_IT Lesson 1- Using Spreadsheets_**

Today, in our first lesson of the year, our group learned how to quickly find the sum of certain quantities of different stock in a table on google spreadsheets. We went to the front of the class to watch our teacher show us how to do it and then had a go ourselves. Firstly we tried doing the sums in slower and more manual ways and then we started to use more advanced settings like 'VLookup' to reach our sum in a quicker and more efficient way. I got quite far before the end of the lesson, the last thing that I didnâ€™t complete was being able to select the stock and make it autocorrect and lead you there by just typing the item in!
