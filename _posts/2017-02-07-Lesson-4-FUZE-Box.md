    <td>Today I actually could not attend the lesson as I was in a semi-final county cup football match but I told my teacher that I would be missing the lesson and still doing a blog post as I have already missed a week because of being absent. I apologise in advance, therefore, if this is shorter and not of as good quality as a normal blog post because I have gathered this small amount of information about what happened in the lesson from my partner Kiran (you can visit his page at this link). In today's lesson I have been told that Kiran worked with another Tom and they coded two exercises. They used the technique of taking turns to read out and write out the coding and by the sounds of how happy Kiran was with the amount of work they got done I would say that it was effective like usual. </td>

    <td>They had a problem whilst saving some coding and they took a few minutes to find out the problem, Kiran seemed to think that the monitor was 'glitching’ but it might have been that they forgot to save the coding correctly or copy it across to their pen drive/ memory stick. In this scenario, I would have needed to work on my patience. This is because I’m quite impatient when it comes to IT and particularly coding and that’s something I need to work on. Also if I’m more impatient I won't be concentrating and as focused to think of ways around the problem or why something might not be working.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time (which will be after half term) I will hopefully actually be in the lesson to get more information onto my memory stick and become better at coding instead of being ill or playing sport. Jokes aside, Kiran mentioned that the book is now beginning to put in mistakes on purpose so you can’t just directly copy the coding and you have to use your own knowledge of coding- and your partner’s- to see what's wrong and tweak it. This will definitely challenge my knowledge and my patience but I want a challenge to become better!</td>
