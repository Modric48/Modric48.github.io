**_IT Lesson 11- Creating Letters in Turtle!_**

In today's lesson we went back to python(with turtle) to draw some letters using code. We had to work out the angles needed for different letters and use a certain amount of pixels for each line to make a good-sized, even shape. 

We first worked out how to do the uppercase A as a class. Using our knowledge of angles we worked out what angles were needed in what direction and then decided on a certain size which we had to keep even throughout the shape.Then we were asked to try and draw (in code) our initials and or a 3-letter word. Luckily for me, we had already coded A and my initials are T and E so I could make the word 'TEA'. Homework: this blog post and finish our letter coding.
