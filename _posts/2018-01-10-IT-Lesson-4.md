**_IT Lesson 4- Embedding Sheets onto our Posts!_**

In today's lesson we worked on improving and adding to our blogs. We learnt how to add one of our documents (google sheets- it is on previous post) to our blogs through embedding and using the "iframe" link to add to our posts. It worked for me but I need to change the pixels on it in the future so it is easier to read and access instead of scrolling through it aimlessly. We also checked our “Virtual Shop” google sheets to make sure they were up to date and I think mine pretty much is so that is good!
