Lesson 10- Microbit

At the start of the lesson we watched a scene from Harry Potter where the hat decided which house the students were going to be in. It linked with microbit as we afterwards then attempted to make a sorting hat on microbit from the link our teacher put on google classroom for us.

The link put us on to a tutorial on one of the codes on microbit (this time it was touchdevelop). We had to follow the tutorials instructions. After we completed that we had a table to fill in to say how the coding the tutorial worked and what it meant to show we understood it.

After that we changed from the Harry Potter houses to the houses from our school- Foxell, Holman, Newman, Pearson, Rayner and Thorne. Then our other task was to change the trigger from when button pressed to when shaken.

Finally we went back on Javascript to try and remake it. We did that until the end of the lesson. This week's homework was to finish of the javascript sorting hat code and do our weekly blog post- which is this. Thank you for reading this week's post!
