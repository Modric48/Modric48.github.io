**_IT Lesson 6- Elaborating our Virtual Shops_**

In today's lesson our teacher showed us how much we can improve our virtual shops. The sheets he showed us had many different factors to it like considering if your business would cost rentwise and or if you hired any employees to help advertise your business. Additionally, with the added factors of costs, prices and tax; the displayed sheets was made to show the profit that you'd make if you sold a certain amount at a certain price over the year. My business idea was to buy electronic items from "CeX Games", make them seem more appealing, and sell them off for more!
