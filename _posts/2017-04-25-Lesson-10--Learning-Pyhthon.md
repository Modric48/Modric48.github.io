  <tr>
    <td>We didn't work in pairs today so when we got to work I was able to be very efficient both on my own in silence and helping others (hinting not actually telling) or being helped myself if I was stuck but still working the final answer out myself. Because of this I got quite a lot done, probably around 20 different mini lessons and one quiz!</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Generally I worked pretty well today so not much was limited in terms of my learning but if I were to be picky then I could have been even more focused during my silent work and tried not to have to go to our teacher for help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try my hardest to work my problem out myself using my knowledge and my reading skills before diverting to asking for my friends or especially the teachers help! By help- again- I mean hint and direct rather than actually tell and do it for me.</td>
