**_IT Lesson 3-Virtual Shop Continuation_**

In today's lesson, our normal teacher was absent so he put some work on Google Classroom to get on with. Before I got on trying the new work; there was a few things I had to fix and complete to make sure I was up to date with the work we had already done. The new work was to do with adding discounts but in a quick and easier way by trying to use words. For example, EVERYTHING 20, would be everything at a 20% discount and Twix 30 would be just the twix at a 30% discount! I found this challenging as I couldn't work out to do it! I wonâ€™t be posting for a few weeks as it is now christmas holidays.
