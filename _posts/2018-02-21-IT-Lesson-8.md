**_IT Lesson 8- Binary Coding_**

Today we started binary coding. We put what all of the characters on a keyboard were in binary and then used it to code. Once we inserted this we tried to test it by adding a code which made a sentence change into binary. For example, below 'hello world' the coding for each letter would come up. Next we used ‘concatenate’ to put all of these numbers together. We also learnt how to make all the binary numbers have a 0 at the start using code. They need this so that the computer knows where a letter starts and ends!
